  Our project is a 3-Body Orbital Simulator that tackles the famous, unsolvable physics 
  problem where three celestial bodies interact gravitationally. We're building a custom 
  physics engine to compute the complex, non-repeating trajectories resulting from their 
  mutual gravitational fields.

  The core feature is an interactive 3D Graphical User Interface (GUI) that vividly renders 
  the three planets orbiting in simulated space. Users can dynamically experiment with the 
  system by using sliders to adjust parameters such as the planets' mass, initial velocity, 
  or density in real-time, instantly observing the resulting chaotic, unpredictable orbital 
  changes.
